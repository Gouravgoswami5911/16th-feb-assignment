    "#Question5:  Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Primary key and foreign key are both important concepts in relational databases that define relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This means that each \n",
    "row in the table must have a unique value for the primary key column(s). Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and \n",
    "help ensure that the data in the table is accurate and consistent. In most databases, primary keys are also used as the basis\n",
    "for creating relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a database with two tables - \"customers\" and \"orders\". The \"customers\" table might have a primary key \n",
    "column called \"customer_id\", which uniquely identifies each customer. The \"orders\" table might have a foreign key column called \n",
    "\"customer_id\", which references the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. This creates a relationship between the two \n",
    "tables, where each order is associated with a specific customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. This creates a relationship between the \n",
    "two tables and allows for data to be joined between the tables. The values in the foreign key column must match the values in \n",
    "the primary key column of the related table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the example above, the \"orders\" table would have a foreign key column called \"customer_id\" that references the primary \n",
    "key column \"customer_id\" in the \"customers\" table. This would ensure that each order is associated with a valid customer in \n",
    "the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys and foreign keys are both important concepts in relational databases. Primary keys are used to\n",
    "uniquely identify each row in a table and enforce data integrity, while foreign keys are used to create relationships between \n",
    "tables by referencing the primary key of another table. Understanding primary keys and foreign keys is important for designing\n",
